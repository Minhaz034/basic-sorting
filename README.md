# Sorting Algorthms

## Overview

This project is a web application designed to compare the performance of various sorting algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface to input the size of an array and select a sorting algorithm to visualize its execution time. Additionally, it offers a comparison feature that displays the performance of all implemented sorting algorithms side-by-side.

## Features

- **Algorithm Selection**: Users can select from a list of sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Quick Sort using 3 medians, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort.
- **Performance Comparison**: A comparative analysis of the execution times for different sorting algorithms on arrays of a specified size.
- **Interactive Chart**: Visualization of algorithm performance using an interactive chart for clear and straightforward comparison.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A micro web framework written in Python used to build the web application.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework used for designing a responsive and mobile-first web interface.
- **Google Charts**: A powerful, simple to use, and free chart library used for creating interactive charts to display the comparison results.

## Running the Project:
